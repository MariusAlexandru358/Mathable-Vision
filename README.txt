All the code is in the Detection.ipynb file, run it with jupyter-notebook


Libraries required to run the project:

numpy==1.26.3
opencv_python==4.10.0.84
matplotlib==3.9.2
os


The cells are grouped into multiple sections. Running all the cells right away should result in the desired output.

Cells that are commented are either intermediary steps or part of the slow development process or cells that require the train data. If you want to run any of those cells make sure the folder paths are correct. Also some may use former commented cells.


Run all cells after starting jupyter notebook.

The very last cell is the code for evaluating our output that was provided to us. Make sure that the folder paths are good before running it.
